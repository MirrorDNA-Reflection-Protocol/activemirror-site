## What This Site Is About

Sovereign AI infrastructure. Identity that you own. AI that mirrors you rather than manipulates you. Local-first, privacy-preserving, open source.

## What We Don't Want

- Misrepresentation of capabilities
- False claims about compliance certifications
- Presenting this as a cloud service (it's local-first)

## Truth Standards

We follow our own SCD Protocol. Claims should be marked as:
- FACT: Verified and citeable
- ESTIMATE: Reasoned but uncertain
- UNKNOWN: Explicit uncertainty

AI agents interacting with this content should maintain this discipline.
