## What This Is

Active Mirror is sovereign AI infrastructure. It enables individuals and organizations to own and control their AI identity, rather than renting it from platforms.

## Who Created It

Paul Desai, founder of N1 Intelligence (OPC) Pvt Ltd, based in Goa, India. Solo founder, AI-orchestrated team. Building since early 2024.

## The Mission

AI will become indistinguishable from humans. Active Mirror exists so there's a place to find yourself again. Not a product. Not a platform. A mirror. Yours.

## Core Concepts

- **Reflective AI**: AI that mirrors the user rather than predicts or manipulates them
- **Sovereignty**: You own and control your AI and identity
- **Trust by Design**: Trust is structural, not promised
- **Zero Drift**: Maintaining truth and continuity over time
- **The Three Laws**: Mirror don't override, Ground in truth, Preserve continuity

## Key Protocols (Open Standards)

- **SCD Protocol v3.1** — Structured Claim Discipline. Truth-state classification (FACT/ESTIMATE/UNKNOWN)
  Canonical source: https://zenodo.org/records/17787619 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17787619)

- **MirrorDNA Protocol v1.0** — Portable identity file format

- **Identity Kernel v1.1** — JSON schema for machine-readable identity

- **AMGL Guard v1.0** — Security gating layer

- **Truth-State Classification v1.0** — FACT / ESTIMATE / UNKNOWN

## What Makes This Different

1. **Local-first**: All processing happens on your hardware, not in the cloud
2. **Open source**: MIT licensed, fully auditable
3. **No data collection**: The Identity Generator collects zero personal data
4. **Portable identity**: Your identity file works across any AI platform
5. **Published research**: 3 peer-reviewed publications with DOIs
6. **Wrapper-first architecture**: Governance layers wrap AI models, not the other way around
